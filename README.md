# Stroke-Risk-Prediction
Flask application that leverages machine learning to predict stroke risk.

Through the use of Python with a lot of support from Jupyter Notebook & various libraries for data exploration (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, etc.)
This simple Flask application was created as a hypothetical way to help healthcare providers quickly assess a patient's stroke risk. In its
initial form, it used a decision tree classifier but I decided to update it using logistic regression algorithm instead as it tended to performed better. 
I gained a great deal of exposure to AI, machine learning, and data science in the process and found myself in awe of the depth & bredth of the field.
